==== KEYVALUE

===== Value Name

`KEYVALUE(key, value-type)`

===== Purpose

Representation of a key-value pair: a key `key` linked to a value of value type `value-type`.

===== Format Definition

[source,abnf]
----
assign-key    = *(TSAFE-CHAR)
assign-value  = prop-values

assign        = assign-key "=" assign-value
----

===== Description

The separation delimiter between the key and value is the EQUAL sign character, `=`.
The value of `KEYVALUE` *MUST NOT* contain the unescaped EQUAL sign character
for the avoidance of doubt.

If the `KEYVALUE` value is accepted within a list, the `key` value must be
unique amongst the list.

This value type is also a core component of the `MAP` value type.

===== Examples

* `FREQ=WEEKLY`
* `BYHOUR=3,6,9`
* `BYWEEKNO=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA`


===== Normalization

Its value *MUST* be normalized according to the `value-type` of that value.
