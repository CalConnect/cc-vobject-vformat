= vObject Property Group

Some vObjects such as the vCard <<RFC6350>> allow tagging a property with a "group". A
group means that a property belongs to a certain grouping and should be displayed
together. Each property **MUST** only have a maximum of one group.

This is useful to represent cases where a group of properties are
closely related to each other. Groups are not ordered and group names
are case-insensitive.

== Normalizing Property Groups

=== Preserved Groups

Property groups **MUST NOT** be removed during normalization. This is contrary
to <<RFC6350>> that allows stripping off groups.
