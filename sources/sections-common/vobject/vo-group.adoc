==== Property group

A property group (or just "group") is used to group a set of
properties, useful to represent cases where a group of properties are
closely related to each other.

In the vCard <<RFC6350>>, the group is used to tie multiple properties
into being displayed together.

Each property *MUST* only have a maximum of one group.

Groups are not ordered and group names are case-insensitive.
