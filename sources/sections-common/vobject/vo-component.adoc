=== Component

A vObject is based on the representation of the "component" element.
All vObjects are composed of at least one component element.

A component:

* *MAY* contain vObject components;

* *MAY* contain properties; and

* *MUST* contain a uniqueness identifier property whose value is called
  the component's "unique identifier".

A component type is identified by the component name, and every
component instance is distinguished by the value of its
uniqueness identifier property.

A component is often used to model an object in the object-oriented
sense, such as a vCard or an iCalendar object.

The order of components *MAY* represent order of the objects, which is
important for example in a `VPATCH` component <<VPATCH>>,
representing the patching order, which is not a commutative process.


[[uniqueness-identifier]]
==== Uniqueness identifying property

As a vObject component can contain inner components, it is important
that those inner components can be distinguished from each other.

A vObject component's uniqueness identifier property is a property whose
value can uniquely identify the immediate component that contains it.

Every vObject component *MUST* contain a single, component uniqueness
identifier property.
The uniqueness identifier property can be different according to component
types, and the uniqueness scope of that property *MAY* be different.
At a minimum, the uniqueness identifier property value *MUST* be unique
within the immediate component that contains the uniqueness identifier
property.

For example:

* a `VCARD` component can be distinguished among other `VCARD`
  components by its `UID` property value that is globally unique;
* a `STANDARD` component of `VTIMEZONE` can be distinguished according to
  its `DTSTART` property within the `VTIMEZONE` component that contains
  it.

The list of uniqueness identifier properties for every vObject component
that complies with this document can be found in the IANA registry described
in <<vobject-uid-registry>>.

New vObject components defined according to this document *MUST* define a
uniqueness identifier property for that component, and it *MUST* be
registered in the said IANA registry.


==== Normalizing a component

===== Sorted component properties

Properties *MUST* be first normalized and before sorted, meaning
that the property's values, and its parameters and its values, have been
normalized.

The sorting of component properties *MUST* be performed according to the
following order:

* alphabetically by the property name. If a property spans multiple content
  lines, the content lines *MUST NOT* be separated after sorting.
* alphabetically by their normalized value.
* alphabetically by treating its parameters as long strings

// TODO: have to define how to sort parameters as long strings...

===== Sorted inner components

Inner components within a vObject must be placed in a sorted order.

The sorting between components *MUST* be performed according to the
following order:

* alphabetically by component type, according to component name,
  such as `VCALENDAR`; then
* if of the same component name, alphabetically according to its
  unique identifier <<uniqueness-identifier>>.

===== Normalized inner components

An inner component *MUST* itself be normalized, meaning that its properties
and inner components *MUST* be normalized.
