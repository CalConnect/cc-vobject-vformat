=== Property

A property can be represented by one content line (a line that ends with
a line break), but can also be "folded" (<<RFC5545,3.1>>)
to use multiple lines.

A property begins with the property name (e.g., `TEL`), followed
by a COLON delimiter and the property's value.

==== Uppercased property name

The property name *MUST* be normalized to uppercase letters.

==== Normalized parameters

The last property parameter of a property *MUST NOT* have a trailing SEMICOLON.

==== Wrapped content line

When exporting a normalized property content line, it *MUST* be folded at the
character limit when it exceeds 75 characters. Each folded line *MUST* be delimited
by the character sequence of a line break and a single white space (CRLF, SPACE (U+0020)).
This rule only applies to normalized output.

// TODO: figure out how to demonstrate line wrapping without overflowing!

For example, the original form:

----
NOTE:This is a very long description on a long line that exceeds 75 characters.
----

When exported to normalized output *MUST* give out:

----
NOTE:This is a very long description on a long line that exceeds 75 charac
 ters.
----
