== vObject Data Model

The vObject data model is the generalized data model from the implied
data models of vCard <<RFC6350>> and iCalendar <<RFC5545>>.

While both vCard <<RFC6350>> and iCalendar <<RFC5545>> specify data formats for different purposes,
the data model behind them follow an identical logical structure (using
components, properties and parameters) with similar requirements.

By creating a generalized data model ("vObject") that is compatible with both,
we are able to ensure that newly developed data modification techniques
for vObject would be interoperable on all other vObject-compliant models.
