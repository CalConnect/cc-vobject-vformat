=== ABNF Format Definition

The following ABNF notation defines the vFormat syntax,
in accordance with <<RFC5234>>, which also defines CRLF,
WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and DIGIT.

A vObject is defined by the following notation in vFormat:

[source=abnf]
----
vobjects = 1*vobject

vobject = "BEGIN:" comp-name CRLF
          *contentline
          *vobject
          "END:" comp-name CRLF

comp-name = name

prop-name = name

prop-values = prop-value / prop-list / prop-structured

prop-value = VALUE-CHAR

prop-list = prop-value *("," prop-value)
  ; An unordered list containing multiple property values

prop-structured = prop-value *(";" prop-value)
  ; A structured list that consist of multiple property fields
  ; for multiple property values

contentline = [group "."] prop-name params ":" prop-values CRLF
  ; Folding and unfolding procedures described in Section 3.2 of
  ; [RFC6350] applies:
  ;   * When parsing a content line, folded lines *MUST* first be
  ;     unfolded accordingly.
  ;   * When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
  ;     characters *SHOULD* be folded accordingly.
  ;   * When normalizing a content line, the content line *MUST*
  ;     be folded when the line is longer than 75 characters.

group = name

params = *(";" param)

param = name "=" param-value *("," param-value)
  ; Allowed parameters depend on property name.

name = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")

NON-ASCII = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
  ; UTF8-{2,3,4} are defined in <<RFC3629>>
  ; TODO: generalize this to UTF-32

QSAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-7E / NON-ASCII
  ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE

SAFE-CHAR = WSP / "!" / %x23-39 / %x3C-7E / NON-ASCII
  ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, ";", ":"

VALUE-CHAR = WSP / VCHAR / NON-ASCII
  ; Any textual character
