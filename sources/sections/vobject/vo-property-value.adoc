==== Property value

A vObject property *MAY* have one or more values, depending on the value type.

vObject property values are strongly typed, just like in <<RFC5545>> and
<<RFC6350>>. Basic value types accepted in vObject properties are defined in
<<vobject-property-value-types>>.

vObject compliant formats *MAY* define additional value types
that are not provided in this document, and *MAY* require separate validation rules,
such as the "RECUR" property value type from iCalendar <<RFC5545>>.

Each property *MUST* define a default value type, and *MAY* accept
alternative, defined, value types.

==== Normalization of property values

The property value generally does not require any normalization.
Please consult individual normalization instructions in each value type's
definition.
